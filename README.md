# CTC32
The [CTC32 Community Safety](https://codethecity.org/what-we-do/hack-weekends/ctc32-community-safety/) hackathon took place on 21-22 Sept 2024.
We had 17 particpants on Saturday, who formed three teams. On Saturday we had two people also drop by for one of the show-and-tell sessions, who offered useful comments to the teams. Sunday, saw 14 people return to continue the work. One other person also showed up on Sunday for the final show and tell.
We thank our sponsors [Absafe](https://www.absafe.org.uk/) and [Dtechtive](https://dtechtive.com)

## Team Bus
Looking at how we might improve the experience of waiting for busses, and wondering how long you might have to wait for a bus. The team decided that the idea was too big, and dissolved itself. Team memebers moved to other teams. See the link to CTC32 for more thoughts about this idea, and how they plan to proceed.

## [Team Let Me Ride](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/Team_Let_Me_Ride)
Looking at creating an automated system to notify taxi companies that people are waiting at a taxi rank.

## [Team Yodo](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/Team_Yodo)
Looking at how we might create an automated system to improve water safety and alert people if someone is in trouble.
